# This project likely aims to:
<br>  

**Predict chemical solubility:** Useful in pharmaceutical and chemical industries to estimate how well compounds dissolve in solvents.<br>
**Compare model performance:** Determine which algorithm best predicts solubility based on molecular descriptors.<br>
**Improve drug discovery pipelines: Assi**st in early-stage screening of potential drug candidates based on their solubility.<br>

# Project Workflow
<br>

**Data Preparation:** Load and preprocess the dataset. <br>
**Model Training:** Compare Linear Regression and Random Forest models.<br>
**Performance Evaluation:** Measure using MSE and R² score.<br>
**Visualization:** Scatter plots of experimental vs predicted solubility values.<br>
